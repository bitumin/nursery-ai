# Nursery AI assistant

An intelligent assistant for nurses. This is an android app for wearables (smartwatches). It integrates sockets.io, dialogflow and speech recognition.

I built it over [this app](https://github.com/mbcrump/FirstGoogleWearableApp) by [MitMichael Crump](http://twitter.com/mbcrump), that already integrates speech recognition, in order to kick-start the development process.
